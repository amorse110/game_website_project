## Website Features: ##
  * As a user, you can filter games by genre, search them by name, and add them to a list of favorites.
  * If you mouse over a game you can see the full description and clicking on a game will open an expanded card with a link that takes you to the website for that game.
  * Any games with the star filled in will be added to your favorites which can be viewed by clicking the favorites button on the top menu.
