As a user, you can filter games by genre, search them by name, and add them to a list of favorites. If you mouse over a game you can see the full description and clicking on a game will open an expanded card with a link that takes you to the website for that game. Any games with the star filled in will be added to your favorites which can be viewed by clicking the favorites button on the top menu.
